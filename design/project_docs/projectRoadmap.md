    * Purpose: High-level goals, features, completion criteria, and progress tracker
    * Update: When high-level goals change or tasks are completed
    * Include: A "completed tasks" section to maintain progress history
    * Format: Use headers (##) for main goals, checkboxes for tasks (- [ ] / - [x])
    * Content: List high-level project goals, key features, completion criteria, and track overall progress
    * Include considerations for future scalability when relevant
    
# UPlant Project Roadmap

## Overview
UPlant is a comprehensive virtual community garden platform designed to help users plan, track, and manage their gardens while engaging with a community of gardeners. This roadmap outlines our high-level objectives, core features, and the progress weâ€™re making toward a scalable, secure, and engaging application.

## High-Level Goals

### 1. User Management & Authentication
- [x] **User Registration & Login:** Establish secure user account creation and authentication.
- [ ] **Social Authentication Integration:** Add Google, Apple, and other social logins.
- [ ] **Account Recovery:** Implement secure password reset and account recovery processes.

**Completion Criteria:**
- Users can register and log in using email or social accounts.
- All authentication endpoints are secured and follow best practices.

---

### 2. Garden Dashboard & Visualization
- [x] **Basic Dashboard UI:** Initial React-based interface displaying essential information.
- [ ] **Dynamic Garden Visualization:** Develop real-time growth indicators and interactive garden maps.
- [ ] **Interactive Layout:** Enable drag-and-drop for garden planning and plant placement.
- [ ] **Notification Integration:** Implement real-time alerts for plant care tasks and weather updates.

**Completion Criteria:**
- The dashboard reflects current garden status, tasks, and notifications.
- Visualization components update dynamically and respond to user interactions.

---

### 3. Community Interaction & Social Features
- [ ] **Discussion Board & Forums:** Create a platform for posts, comments, and upvoting.
- [ ] **Post Creation & Interaction:** Allow users to publish, comment, and like posts.
- [ ] **Moderation Tools:** Develop systems for user feedback, moderation, and community guidelines enforcement.

**Completion Criteria:**
- Users can engage in community discussions with seamless posting and commenting.
- Moderation tools are in place to ensure a safe and constructive environment.

---

### 4. Backend & API Enhancements
- [x] **Initial Django Setup:** Basic models for users, gardens, and plants are in place.
- [ ] **API Documentation & Standards:** Expand and document RESTful endpoints.
- [ ] **Third-Party Integrations:** Integrate external services (e.g., weather data) for enhanced notifications.

**Completion Criteria:**
- API endpoints are fully documented and adhere to RESTful standards.
- The backend is structured to support scalability and additional features.

---

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **Repository Setup:** Initial project structure and repository configuration.
- [x] **UI Scaffold:** Basic login and dashboard interfaces implemented.
- [x] **Backend Models:** Core Django models for user, garden, and plant management established.

---

## Future Scalability Considerations
- **Performance Optimization:** Implement caching and load balancing as user traffic increases.
- **Modular Architecture:** Maintain a modular codebase for easy addition of new features.
- **Enhanced Security:** Regular security audits and protocol updates.
- **User Feedback Integration:** Build tools to collect and analyze user feedback for iterative improvements.

---

## Overall Progress Tracker
- **User Management:** 40% complete
- **Garden Dashboard:** 30% complete
- **Community Features:** 10% complete
- **Backend/API Enhancements:** 50% complete

---

## Next Steps
1. Enhance the garden dashboard with interactive visualizations and real-time updates.
2. Begin development on the discussion board and community interaction modules.
3. Expand API documentation to support newly added endpoints and third-party integrations.
4. Review scalability considerations and plan for performance optimizations.
