# Current Task: Refactor Login Workflow

## Overview
The goal is to transition from the legacy Django-based login page to a modern, React-based login component. This update will improve the user experience and align with our new frontend architecture while ensuring secure authentication integration with the backend.

## Task Details

- **Objective:**  
  Replace the existing Django login template with a React login page, ensuring smooth authentication and proper error handling.

- **Context:**  
  - The new React login component is located at `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`.
  - The Django backend continues to handle authentication, so integration via API endpoints must remain secure and reliable.
  - Legacy Django templates for login are slated for deprecation once the new flow is verified.

- **Relevant Documentation:**  
  - [projectRoadmap.md](./projectRoadmap.md) – High-level project goals and milestones.  
  - [techStack.md](./techStack.md) – Details on the chosen technology and architectural decisions.  
  - [codebaseSummary.md](./codebaseSummary.md) – Overview of the project structure and recent changes.

## Steps to Complete

1. **Review Current Implementations:**
   - Examine the existing Django login template and React login component.
   - Identify the authentication endpoints and data flow between frontend and backend.

2. **Update React Login Component:**
   - Enhance `Login.jsx` to include robust error handling and loading states.
   - Validate user inputs and ensure proper communication with the Django backend.
   - Implement redirection upon successful login.

3. **Deprecate Legacy Code:**
   - Remove or comment out the old Django login template after confirming the new React login works seamlessly.
   - Update the routing in the React Router setup to reflect the new login page.

4. **Testing & Validation:**
   - Write unit and integration tests for the updated login workflow.
   - Manually test the login process across different devices and screen sizes.
   - Confirm that error messages and loading indicators are displayed correctly.

5. **Documentation & Review:**
   - Update `codebaseSummary.md` with details of the new login flow.
   - Create a pull request and request a peer review to ensure adherence to security standards and functionality.

## Risks and Considerations

- **Security:**  
  Ensure that the transition maintains secure authentication practices and that no vulnerabilities are introduced during the refactoring.

- **User Experience:**  
  Verify that the new login process is smooth and intuitive. Pay special attention to edge cases, such as incorrect credentials or network failures.

- **Dependencies:**  
  Check for potential conflicts with existing API endpoints and update any related documentation accordingly.

## Next Steps Post-Completion

1. Merge the changes after a successful code review.
2. Deploy the updated login workflow to the staging environment for broader testing.
3. Update the project roadmap and tech stack documents to reflect these changes.
4. Gather user feedback on the new login process and iterate as needed.
