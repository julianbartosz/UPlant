"""
URL Configuration for User Management in UPlant

This module defines URL patterns for user authentication, account creation,
and password management using Django's template-based views. These URLs serve
traditional HTML views rather than API endpoints, which are defined separately
in api/urls.py.

URL Structure:
- /create-account/ - New user registration
- /change-password/ - Form to change password for logged-in users
- /password_reset/ - Initiates password recovery workflow
- /password_reset/done/ - Confirmation that reset email was sent
- /reset/<uidb64>/<token>/ - Link sent in reset email to verify user
- /reset/done/ - Confirmation that password reset was successful

Note: This configuration customizes Django's built-in auth views with UPlant-specific
templates, email formats, and success URLs.
