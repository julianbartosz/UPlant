User Management Views for UPlant

This module contains Django class-based views for handling user-related operations
through traditional Django templates (not API endpoints). These views manage:
1. User registration/creation
2. Password changes
3. User profile updates

These template-based views complement the API endpoints defined in api/views.py
and are primarily used for the web interface.
